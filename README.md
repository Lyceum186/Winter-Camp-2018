## 2. Winter Camp Schedule

The Winter Camp provides a 10-day intensive training in Python programming and its
applications in Economics. Roughly, in the first 5 days, we focus on handing out tools, and in the
later 5 days, instructors will teach topics in Economics.

On each day, lectures will be held in the morning from 9:00AM to 12:00PM. Then in the
afternoon, from 2:00PM to 6:00PM, students will be divided into groups to work on assigned
projects. Computer lab will remain open between 19:30PM to 22:00PM for students who wish to study in the evening. Several guest lectures will be offered in early afternoons throughout the Winter Camp, in which
Economists from various fields will talk about how the tools and methods we go over in the
Winter Camp are applied in real-life Economic research.

Below is a summary schedule for instructors and topics of the Winter Camp.
